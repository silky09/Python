#Lists are created using square brackets []

#List items are ordered, Indexed, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

#List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

#The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

#Lists allow 
#ordered
#Indexed
#changeable
#duplicate values:



list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(list)
print(list[2]) #cherry

list[1] = "mango"
print(list) #returns ['apple', 'mango', 'cherry', 'apple', 'cherry']
